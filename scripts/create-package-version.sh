# This script uses SFDX to generate a new version of a package, creating the package if needed.
# Package versions are what actually get installed into Orgs.
# Prior to running this script and generating the package, it is expected the developer:
# - Verified that all package components are in the project directory where you want to create
#   the package
# - Setup the Namespace and specified the "namespace" key in sfdx-project.json
# 2GP workflow documentation see: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp_workflow.htm
